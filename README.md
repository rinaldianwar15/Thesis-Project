# Thesis-Project - Multiphase Flow Modelling of Severe Slugging
 ### 1. The model is based on simplified 1D severe slugging from multiphase flow lecture in NTNU Trondheim.
 ### 2. The model can be useful for sensitivity analysis of various parameters (diameter, inclination lengths, pressures, etc.) 
 ### 3. the model can also demonstrate that severe slugging can be eliminated by a choke. 
 ### 4. The code is also includes severe slugging generating region based on the flow regime occurrence in the riser-pipeline system. 
 ### 5. The region can distinguish between slug, annular, dispersed bubble, stratified, and severe slugging in a downward pipeline-riser system.
