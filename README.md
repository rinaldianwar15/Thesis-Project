# Thesis-Project
 # The model can be useful for sensitivity analysis of various parameters (diameter, inclination lengths, pressures, etc.) 
 # the model can also demonstrate that severe slugging can be eliminated by a choke. 
 # The work is also including a severe slugging generating region based on the flow regime occurrence in the riser-pipeline system. 
 # The region can distinguish between slug, annular, dispersed bubble, stratified, and severe slugging in a downward pipeline-riser system.
